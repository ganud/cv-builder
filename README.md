A relatively complete CV-Builder made with React. Functional, but no edit, deletion, or localstorage.

<div>Comment:</div>
<div>Not too proud of this one, considering I fumbled too much with passing the form inputs to the HTML preview.</div>
<div>Passing the parent's setter to a child allows the child to change the parent's state by unpacking the prop.</div>
<div>Trying to pass data from child to grand-parent though, I can barely try to make out.</div>
